# Kalman_Filter_Based_Sensor_Fusion_for_Multi_Camera_Hand_Tracking

This repository contains the implementation of a system for improving joint angle estimation in prosthetic hands by fusing dual camera sensors using Kalman filters. The project leverages **MediaPipe** for hand tracking and **YOLO** for real-time hand-object interaction tracking, with an evaluation based on the Grasp Quality Index.

## Features
- **Kalman Filter Implementation**: 
  - Combines data from dual camera sensors to enhance the accuracy of joint angle estimation for prosthetic hands.
  - Improves reliability of joint estimation without requiring explicit camera calibration.

- **Hand Tracking with MediaPipe**: 
  - Utilizes MediaPipe for accurate joint angle estimation.

- **Object Interaction Tracking with YOLO**:
  - Real-time detection and tracking of hand-object interactions.
  - Evaluation of the fused model based on the Grasp Quality Index.
